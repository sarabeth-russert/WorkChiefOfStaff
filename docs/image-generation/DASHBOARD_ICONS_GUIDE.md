2. **Iterate**: Generate multiple variations and pick the best
3. **Consistency**: All icons should feel like they belong to the same visual family

## File Naming Convention

Save all generated icons in `/packages/client/public/images/dashboard/` with these exact names:

**Quick Stats Metric Card Icons (3 unique icons needed):**
- `wellness.png` - Wellness/readiness score
- `calendar.png` - Today's meetings (also reused by Outbound Passage feature card)
- `assignments.png` - Active assignments (also reused by Field Assignments feature card)

**Feature Card Icons (2 additional unique icons needed):**
- `expedition.png` - Expedition/AI agent chat
- `base-camp.png` - Base Camp/daily planning hub

**Total**: 5 unique icons to generate (2 are reused across multiple cards)

---

## After Generation

Once you've generated all 5 unique icons:

1. **Save to directory**: Place all PNG files in `/packages/client/public/images/dashboard/`
2. **Verify images**: Ensure all are 512x512px with transparent backgrounds
3. **Test in UI**: The Dashboard will automatically display them with fallback to emoji
4. **Optimize** (optional): Use TinyPNG to reduce file sizes while maintaining quality

---

## Implementation

The images will be automatically integrated into the Dashboard when they're present in the directory. The Dashboard component has fallback logic to show emoji if images fail to load.

**Image paths currently in Dashboard.jsx:**
```javascript
// Quick Stats Metric Cards
iconImage="/images/dashboard/wellness.png"      // Wellness Score → /medic
iconImage="/images/dashboard/calendar.png"      // Today's Meetings → /outbound-passage
iconImage="/images/dashboard/assignments.png"   // Active Assignments → /jira

// Feature Cards
iconImage="/images/dashboard/expedition.png"    // Expedition → /expedition
iconImage="/images/dashboard/assignments.png"   // Field Assignments → /jira (REUSED)
iconImage="/images/dashboard/base-camp.png"     // Base Camp → /base-camp
iconImage="/images/dashboard/calendar.png"      // Outbound Passage → /outbound-passage (REUSED)
```

---

## Visual Design Goals

Each icon should:
- ✅ Feel cohesive with other dashboard icons
- ✅ Match the vintage Adventureland aesthetic
- ✅ Be immediately recognizable at small sizes (64px+)
- ✅ Use the warm earth-tone color palette
- ✅ Have a hand-drawn, retro poster quality
- ✅ Work on both light cream backgrounds and canvas textures
