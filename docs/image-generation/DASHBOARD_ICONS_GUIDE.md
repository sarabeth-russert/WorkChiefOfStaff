## Generation Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Use both prompts**: Try both the detailed and simplified versions
2. **Iterate**: Generate multiple variations and pick the best
3. **Consistency**: All icons should feel like they belong to the same visual family
4. **Color harmony**: Use the specified color palette to match the Adventureland theme
5. **Transparent backgrounds**: Ensure PNGs have transparent backgrounds for overlay on cards

### Recommended AI Tools:
- **Midjourney**: Best for vintage poster aesthetics
- **DALL-E 3**: Good for clean, controlled results
- **Stable Diffusion**: More control over style

### Style Keywords to Emphasize:
- "Vintage 1950s-60s"
- "Disney Adventureland poster style"
- "SEA (Society of Explorers and Adventurers)"
- "Hand-drawn aesthetic"
- "Flat illustration"
- "Retro poster art"
- "Warm earth tones"

---

## File Naming Convention

Save all generated icons in `/packages/client/public/images/dashboard/` with these exact names:

**Quick Stats Icons:**
- `active-agents.png`
- `managed-apps.png`
- `knowledge-items.png`

**Feature Card Icons:**
- `expedition.png`
- `trading-post.png`
- `map-room.png`
- `outpost.png`

---

## After Generation

Once you've generated all 7 icons:

1. **Save to directory**: Place all PNG files in `/packages/client/public/images/dashboard/`
2. **Verify images**: Ensure all are 512x512px with transparent backgrounds
3. **Test in UI**: The Card component will automatically display them with fallback to emoji
4. **Optimize** (optional): Use TinyPNG to reduce file sizes while maintaining quality

---

## Implementation

The images will be automatically integrated into the Dashboard when they're present in the directory. The Card component has been updated to support both image icons and emoji fallbacks, ensuring the UI works perfectly whether images are loaded or not.

**Image paths in code:**
```javascript
// Quick Stats
iconImage="/images/dashboard/active-agents.png"
iconImage="/images/dashboard/managed-apps.png"
iconImage="/images/dashboard/knowledge-items.png"

// Feature Cards
iconImage="/images/dashboard/expedition.png"
iconImage="/images/dashboard/trading-post.png"
iconImage="/images/dashboard/map-room.png"
iconImage="/images/dashboard/outpost.png"
```

---

## Visual Design Goals

Each icon should:
- ✅ Feel cohesive with other dashboard icons
- ✅ Match the vintage Adventureland aesthetic
- ✅ Be immediately recognizable at small sizes (64px+)
- ✅ Use the warm earth-tone color palette
- ✅ Have a hand-drawn, retro poster quality
- ✅ Work on both light cream backgrounds and canvas textures
