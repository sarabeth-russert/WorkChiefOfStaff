## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Option 1: Full Header Banners

Display large hero images at the top of each page:

```jsx
<div className="relative h-64 overflow-hidden rounded-lg mb-8">
  <img
    src="/images/pages/expedition-header.png"
    alt="Expedition"
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-cream opacity-50" />
</div>
```

### Option 2: Background Illustrations

Use as subtle backgrounds behind page content:

```jsx
<div
  className="min-h-screen bg-cover bg-center"
  style={{backgroundImage: 'url(/images/pages/expedition-header.png)'}}
>
  <div className="backdrop-blur-sm bg-cream bg-opacity-90">
    {/* Page content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Option 3: Card Headers

Use smaller versions as card decorations:

```jsx
<Card>
  <img
    src="/images/pages/expedition-header.png"
    className="h-32 w-full object-cover rounded-t-lg"
  />
  <div className="p-6">
    {/* Card content */}
  </div>
</Card>
```

## 🔧 Post-Generation Processing

### Optimize Images

Images at 1920x600 may be large. Optimize them:

```bash
# Using ImageMagick (if installed)
convert expedition-header.png -quality 85 -strip expedition-header.png

# Or use online tools:
# https://tinypng.com - Best compression
# https://squoosh.app - More control
```

**Target sizes:**
- Full quality: 200-500KB per image
- Optimized: 100-200KB per image

### Add Texture Overlay (Optional)

For extra vintage feel:

```bash
# Add paper texture overlay using ImageMagick
convert expedition-header.png \
  -colorspace gray \
  +level-colors '#3A3226','#FFF8E7' \
  -modulate 100,80 \
  expedition-header-vintage.png
```

## 📊 Size Recommendations

### Performance vs Quality Trade-offs:

| Size | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|------|----------|------|------|
| **1920x600px** | Desktop hero banners | High quality, immersive | 500KB-2MB per image |
| **1200x400px** | Balanced | Good quality, reasonable size | May pixelate on large screens |
| **960x300px** | Mobile-optimized | Fast loading, small size | Lower detail |

**Recommendation:** Generate at 1920x600, then create optimized versions:

```bash
# Create multiple sizes
convert expedition-header.png -resize 1920x600 expedition-header-full.png
convert expedition-header.png -resize 1200x400 expedition-header-medium.png
convert expedition-header.png -resize 960x300 expedition-header-small.png
```

Then use responsive images:

```jsx
<img
  src="/images/pages/expedition-header-medium.png"
  srcSet="/images/pages/expedition-header-small.png 960w,
          /images/pages/expedition-header-medium.png 1200w,
          /images/pages/expedition-header-full.png 1920w"
  alt="Expedition"
/>
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Generate all 4 together** in one session for consistency
2. **Request landscape format explicitly** (wide banner, horizontal)
3. **Specify 1920x600 dimension** in the prompt
4. **Keep the SEA style consistent** across all images
5. **Use similar lighting** (warm afternoon/golden hour)
6. **Maintain visual hierarchy** (foreground objects, mid-ground detail, background atmosphere)

### If AI generator has issues with dimensions:

Generate square (1024x1024), then:
```bash
# Crop to landscape banner
convert square-image.png -gravity center -crop 1920x600+0+0 banner-image.png
```
